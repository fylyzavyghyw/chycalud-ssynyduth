Overview
Girl Grit: Savage Not Average is the first book in the empowering Human Empowerment trilogy for women worldwide. Dr. Elinsky guides readers through a profound journey of harmonizing thought and emotion, exploring personal fulfillment and experience. She transforms her readers from doormats-controlled, manipulated, and walked over by others-into daredevils, fearless warrior women living without regret. Discover what it means to go from average to savage in this emotional, action-packed self-help adventure that will not only inspire you but also challenge societal conditioning to be a &#039;good girl&#039; focused on serving and pleasing others. In Girl Grit, Dr. Elinsky passionately challenges and dismantles restrictive gender roles, asserting that they limit our potential as women and undermine our purpose as equal human beings. As an expert in gender relationship dynamics, Dr. Elinsky draws on extensive research to critically examine the very fabric of our social conditioning. She urges, &quot;It is time to wise up, rise up, and ascend to your highest potential.&quot; Celebrating the worthiness and grandeur of women&#039;s capacities, Girl Grit will elevate you to unimaginable heights. Finally, Dr. Elinsky advises, &quot;Do not read this book unless you are ready to revolutionize your life as you know it.&quot; Learn what it means to become a fire woman and unleash your regal authority into the world. Girl Grit will set your self-esteem on fire.
