In this sapphic dual POV romance by Adiba Jaigirdar, Meghna and Rani (ex-best-friends-turned-rivals) realize they&amp;#039;re dating the same guy, so they team up to beat and expose him at a big science competition!
 
 Meghna Rahman is tired of constantly being compared to her infuriatingly perfect ex best friend now rival. Everyone, except, at least, her boyfriend Zak, seems to think that Rani Choudhury can do no wrongâ€”even her own parents! It doesnâ€™t help that Rani is always accepted into the Young Scientist Exhibition, while Meghnaâ€™s projects never make it. But this year, she finally has a chance at defeating Rani in something.
 
 Rani Choudhury is tired of feeling like she doesnâ€™t have much say in her lifeâ€”not when it comes to how her mom wants her to look and act or how her parents encourage her to date incredibly charming close family friend Zak. She would much rather focus on her coding, especially once she places high enough at the Young Scientist Exhibition to go on to the European Young Scientist Exhibition
 
 When Meghna and Rani figure out that Zak has been playing them both, they decide to do something no one would see coming: they team up. Theyâ€™ll compete in the EYSE as partners, creating an app that exposes cheaters and a project that exposes Zak. But with years of silence and pressure between them, working together will prove difficult. Especially once each girl starts to realize that the feelings they had for the other may have been more than platonic...
 
 Hey, no one ever said science was easy!
