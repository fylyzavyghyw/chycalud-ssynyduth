 I triple dog dare you...
 
 As senior year comes to an end, senior pranks are just beginning. It all starts innocently enough. Marley and her friendsâ€”Atlas, Lucia, and Jesseâ€”egg houses, set chickens free on the quad, and fill the principalâ€™s office with glitter-filled balloons.
 
 But when Jesse accepts a dare to drive danger alley, a ten-mile stretch of winding road thatâ€™s notorious for car wrecks, with no headlights, things take a turn for the worst.
 
 Now, the four friends are bound by a tragic accidentâ€”and a dark secret that threatens their bright futures.
