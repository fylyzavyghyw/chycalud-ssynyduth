A drunken dare turns into a college student’s chance to confront his own sexuality—by visiting a male brothel!
 
 For college student Haiga, starting school in the big city is a chance to make new friends and try new things. He joins a music club and, during introductions, spots the impossibly gorgeous upperclassman—and fellow music major—Kanae strumming a guitar. So imagine Haiga’s surprise when later, during a drunken dare to visit a brothel, he finds his new crush employed as a sex worker!
 
 Haiga is further overjoyed when during their club’s music camp, he’s able to perform together with Kanae, and it’s during this time that he finally realizes his feelings for the upperclassman go beyond simple admiration. But his joy is quickly negated when his crush tells him to stop coming to the brothel. Is Kanae simply concerned for Haiga&amp;#039;s health because of how hard he’s been working so he can afford to see him, or could it be that Kanae has finally found his special someone and left the brothel altogether?
